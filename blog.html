    <! –– Streamlit ––> 

    <h2>Streamlit:</h2>
    <p>Streamlit is a tool meant to help create website in seconds, it takes very few lines of code to create amazing websites. There also HTML and CSS integrations that make cutstomatization extremely easy and today I'm gonna over how to use it. 
    </p>

    <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
    <p>To initialize streamlit, the first thing you need to do is make sure <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python</a> is installed.</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Have a code editor open (I'm using vs code) that can run python and terminals </li>
        <li>run the command "pip install streamlit"</li>
        <ul>
            <p>This installs the streamlit library onto your computer so you can actually get starting using streamlit</p>
        </ul>
        <li>Check out some of the public <a href="https://streamlit.io/gallery"> projects available </a>to get a sense of what you are going to be able to do</li>
        <li>When working with streamlit keeping this  <a href="https://cheat-sheet.streamlit.app/"> cheat sheet</a> handy helps </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Getting you first website up</h3>
    <p>To use streamlit you need to import it into your code editor
        <li>import streamlit as st - this allows us to call any action of the streamlit library by starting the command with st instead of typing out Streamlit</li> <br>
        You will see almost all tutorial use "st" when referring to streamlit. You can name it whatever you want but the standard convention is st
    </p>
